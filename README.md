# YouTube-Video-Classifier 🎥

This project utilizes Python and SK-learn to create an AI model 🤖. By training on diverse YouTube video data, the model predicts whether a video is educative or not. Additionally, a user-friendly website allows users to input video URLs and view the classification output.

## Overview 🌟

The YouTube-Video-Classifier project offers the following features:

- **AI Model**: Utilizes Python and SK-learn to build a robust model capable of classifying YouTube videos as educative or non-educative.

- **Training Data**: Training data from various YouTube videos ensures the model's accuracy and effectiveness in classification tasks.

- **Website Interface**: A user-friendly website interface allows users to input video URLs and instantly view the classification results.

## How it Works 🛠️

1. **Model Training**: The AI model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising YouTube videos labeled as educative or non-educative.

2. **Prediction**: Upon receiving a video URL input from the user, the model predicts whether the video falls into the educative category or not.

3. **Website Interface**: The website interface provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the AI model, making it easy to input video URLs and view classification results.

## Chrome Extension 🌐

In addition to the website interface, a Chrome extension is being developed to make the YouTube-Video-Classifier more accessible to users. This extension will allow users to classify videos directly from their browser with just a click.

## API Integration 🚀

For developers and applications looking to integrate video classification functionality, an API is available. Simply send video title, tags, and description to fetch the desired classification output.

## Contributions 🤝

Contributions to enhance and expand the functionality of the YouTube-Video-Classifier project are welcome! Whether it's improving the AI model's accuracy, refining the website interface, or adding features to the Chrome extension, your contributions are valued.
